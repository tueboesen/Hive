# Hive board game

This is a hobby project of mine where I have coded up a board game called [hive](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive).
For now this project contains a working version of the game which can be played by 2 players.

I am currently developing a monte carlo tree search neural network to play this game, in a separate project, but once that is completed the two projects will likely be merged. 

If you want to play a game of hive, simply run main.py
